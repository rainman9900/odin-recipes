      <li>1/4 c. pine nuts</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 c. basil leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 c. finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil</li>

      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al
        dente. Reserve ¼ cup pasta water, then drain pasta in a colander. Rinse
        and transfer pasta to a large bowl to cool.
      </li>

        Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium-low heat, cook pine nuts until
        just beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
        softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Let cool.
      </li>

        In the bowl of a food processor, combine pine nut-garlic mixture, basil,
        Parmesan, oil, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse five or six times until
        mostly smooth. Add reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and
        pulse to reach desired texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pesto and cherry tomatoes to the pasta and toss to combine. Serve
        topped with additional Parmesan.
