    <img src="pasta-salad-img.png" />
    <p>
      The star of this pasta salad is the fresh, homemade pesto. All you’ll need
      is pine nuts, garlic, basil, a good quality olive oil, a generous helping
      of Parmesan, and lemon juice. We recommend using your nicest olive oil
      recipe. The flavor will really shine through, so it makes a difference to
      use the higher quality stuff in this recipe—trust us.

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. short pasta, such as fusilli or penne</li>
      <li>1/4 c. pine nuts</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 c. basil leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 c. finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>1/4 c. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp. lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 pt. grape or cherry tomatoes, halved lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al
        dente. Reserve ¼ cup pasta water, then drain pasta in a colander. Rinse
        and transfer pasta to a large bowl to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium-low heat, cook pine nuts until
        just beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook until
        softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a food processor, combine pine nut-garlic mixture, basil,
        Parmesan, oil, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse five or six times until
        mostly smooth. Add reserved pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and
        pulse to reach desired texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pesto and cherry tomatoes to the pasta and toss to combine. Serve
        topped with additional Parmesan.
