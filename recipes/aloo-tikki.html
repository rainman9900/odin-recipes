      This is a delicious vegan Indian recipe where vegetables and chickpeas are
      served over small potato cakes. It works well as a starter for four, or as
      a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate,
      serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for
      Indian sauces - coriander sauce and tamarind sauce - are on this site.
      Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices
      of fresh onion.

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a
        boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20
        minutes. Drain and peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cooked potatoes into a bowl and add cornstarch, ginger, cumin,
        cayenne, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Mash together with a fork. Oil your
        hands with a little vegetable oil and divide the potato mixture into 4
        equal portions. Pat each portion into a potato patty about 1/3-inch
        thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry
        potato cakes until golden, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from
        heat and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>Grind peppercorns and cloves with a mortar and pestle.</li>
      <li>
        Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet over
        medium-high heat. Stir in red chile peppers, cumin, bay leaves. Add
        onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook and stir until onion is golden, about 5
        minutes. Add pepper-clove mixture, curry powder, and turmeric.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix tomato paste with water. Stir diluted tomato paste and tomato into
        the skillet. Cook over medium heat until the tomato has softened, about
        5 minutes. Stir in chickpeas and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon chickpea sauce over the potato cakes and sprinkle with cilantro
        leaves.
      </li>
    </ol>
