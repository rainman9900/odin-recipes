      This is a delicious vegan Indian recipe where vegetables and chickpeas are
      served over small potato cakes. It works well as a starter for four, or as
      a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate,
      serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for
      Indian sauces - coriander sauce and tamarind sauce - are on this site.
      Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices
      of fresh onion.
