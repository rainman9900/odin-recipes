    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <p>
      Indian-style boiled peanuts are a special treat, completely different from
      the standard dry-roasted peanuts you find in stores. Boiling them
      completely changes the texture. Instead of being hard and crunchy, they
      are softer but still have a nice bite. Still, you get that softness and
      sweet, oily taste of the peanuts.
